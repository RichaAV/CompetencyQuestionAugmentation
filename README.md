Competency Question Augmentation for Knowledge Graphs using Large Language Models (GPT-4, GPT-3.5-Turbo, LLaMA2, T5) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques

In the rapidly evolving field of data science, knowledge graphs (KGs) have emerged as powerful tools for representing semantic relationships within domain-specific data. These graph-like structures facilitate the organization and retrieval of information, playing a crucial role in various applications such as Google Search, virtual assistants like Alexa and Siri, and numerous other intelligent systems .

The creation of a knowledge graph is a complex process that begins with determining the scope and content of the graph. This is typically achieved through Competency
Questions (CQs), which are natural language questions that a KG should be able to answer. Despite their importance, formulating clear and concise CQs poses a significant challenge for practitioners. The difficulty lies in ensuring that these questions are comprehensive enough to cover the domain’s essential aspects while being precise and unambiguous.

This project aims to address the challenge of CQ formulation by exploring the augmentation of existing CQ datasets using large language models (LLMs). Specifically,
the research will:
• Investigate the use of LLMs for generating and suggesting additional CQs: By leveraging the capabilities of LLMs and prompt engineering techniques, this study
seeks to expand and enhance existing CQ datasets.
• Evaluate the augmented CQs using current NLP metrics: The effectiveness of the newly generated CQs will be assessed using established natural language processing
(NLP) evaluation metrics to ensure their relevance and quality.
These aims support the broader goal of facilitating the KG engineering process, making it easier for practitioners to develop comprehensive and effective knowledge graphs
